    <h1><font color="red"</h1>about her.</h1>
    <p>Elara moved through the bustling market of Silverwood
      like a shadow, her hooded cloak concealing her face. Few
      noticed the intricate silver ring she wore, a royal crest
      from a kingdom she had abandoned years ago. She bartered
      for herbs and listened to rumors, always alert. Her past
      as Princess Aurelia haunted her, a life of gilded cages
      and political schemes she had fled to find freedom. But
      whispers of a growing darkness in her homeland tugged at
      her conscience, a call she couldn't ignore. The crown she
      had rejected might be the only thing that could save them 
      all, but revealing her true identity would put her,
      and everyone she cared about, in mortal danger.</p>
